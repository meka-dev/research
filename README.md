# Mekatek Research
This repo will be the center place for documenting and maintaining Mekatek's data science and research initiatives.

The goal is to open-source the code used to publish research articles in https://meka.tech/writing

The repo will include:
* Each publication's code can be found in the Report report
* Doocumentation and maintenance of any code used to perform such analysis (SQL queries from Numia, Python Notebooks, Google Sheets, etc.)
* Please reach out to @therealpixelverse in TG for any questions

## Running SQL queries
If you want to replicate all SQL queries please refer to https://docs.numia.xyz/overview/what-is-numia-data to get access to all public datasets from Nhmia.

## Python Notebooks
All python notebooks are run using Python 3. They can be run locally, make sure to install dependencies if needed.
