* Given the size of the data we've put the files [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VdPfmhLDYIOjZNdEqlAIU0pSkFYqumX9/view?usp=sharing)
* The python notebook reads from the files in the folder but also stores them there.
* The raw data is in the `.json` files within each of the chains folders (canto, evmos, cronos and osmosis)
* Raw data was pulled from dexscreener
